# Ludus

## Introduction

Ludus is my entry for the [fifth montly #bbg game creation challenge](
https://github.com/hughfdjackson/bbgchallenge5), which ran from
15th April to 15th May 2012. During that timeframe each participant was allowed
to spend a total of 12 hours on his/her game.

The randomly selected genre was Sports Sim. I decided to bend that theme a
little and make a game about gladiators, Rome's ancient athletes.


## About the game

You control three gladiators which face another team of three gladiators in the
arena. Try to kill the enemy gladiators by attacking them. Reduce the damage to
your own gladiators by blocking the enemy's attacks.

As mentioned above, I spent only 12 hours developing that game. Too much of that
time was spent on the interface, too little on the actual gameplay. I hope you
enjoy it nonetheless.

The game was written by [Hanno Braun](http://hannobraun.com) using the [noop
HTML5 game library](https://github.com/hbraun/noop).

Play it here: [http://hbraun.github.com/ludus](http://hbraun.github.com/ludus)


## Controls

Click on one of your gladiators (the three in the lower row) to select him. Then
move the mouse to an enemy gladiator and click on either "attack" or "block".
You can always attack another gladiator, but you can only block gladiators that
are currenly attacking.

The goal is to kill all enemy gladiators. You will lose the game if all your own
gladiators are dead.


## Attacking and blocking

If you sucessfully manage to attack an enemy, you will do damage to him. How
much depends on your weapon.

You can prevent an attack by blocking it. The attack will still do some damage,
but it will be reduced and be dealt to the blocking gladiator instead of the
initial target. How much the damage is reduced depends on the weapon the
blocking gladiator is using.


## Weapons

You may notice that the gladiators have different weapons: Spears, swords and
shields. Each of those have different strenghts and weaknesses.

Spear
- High damage
- Bad at blocking

Sword
- Medium damage
- Ok at blocking

Shield
- Low damage
- Good at blocking
